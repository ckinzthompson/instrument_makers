## Overview: 
 A test tube holder for one single test tube 
  Put a picture here of the test tube holder 


## Background:
The test tube rack was taking up a lot of space in the incubator and it was meant to hold about 10-15 test tubes. Since our usage was between 1-3 test tubes, we decided to come up with a test tube holder that would conserve the limited space we had. 

## Equipment:
Prusa i3 MK3S+ fused filament 3D printer

## Instructions: 
* Using [OpenSCAD](openscad.org), we came up with this code for the testtube that is used in the lab which can be found [here](test_tube_holder_v3.scad)

* Convert the OpenSCAD file to be compatible with your 3D printer
* Slice the file on your 3D printer
* Print out the test tube holder 



# Next Steps
* make a holder using this as a base idea to hold more test tubes
